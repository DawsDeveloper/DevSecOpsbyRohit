## üìå What is Docker?

**Docker** is an open-source platform that enables containerization ‚Äî packaging applications with their dependencies into isolated units called **containers**. It ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

* Docker is a containerization tool.
* Virtualization -> Fixed hardware allocation
* Process Isolation -> Dependency in OS is removed
* In comparision to the traditional virtualization functionalities of hypervisors, Docker containers eliminate the need for a separate guest operating system for every new virtual machine.
* Docker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation.
* A docker container enables rapid deployment with minimum run-time requirements. It also ensures better management and simplified portability. This helps developers and operations team in rapid deployment of an application.

## üÜö Containerization vs Virtualization

| Feature               | Virtualization                              | Containerization                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| OS Usage              | Full OS per VM                              | Shared OS, isolated environments               |
| Boot Time             | Minutes                                     | Seconds                                        |
| Resource Efficiency   | Heavy (needs full OS per VM)                | Lightweight (shares OS kernel)                |
| Performance Overhead  | High                                         | Low                                            |
| Use Case              | Legacy apps, full isolation                 | Microservices, DevOps, fast deployment         |

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Containerization

- **Lightweight** and fast
- **Portable** across different systems
- **Isolated** environments
- Ideal for **CI/CD pipelines**
- Simplifies **deployment** and **scaling**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing Docker

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing Docker on Azure (Red Hat Linux VM)

This section explains how to install Docker on a **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** virtual machine created in **Microsoft Azure**.

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è 1. Create a Linux VM on Azure

- Go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
- Navigate to **Virtual Machines** ‚Üí **Create** ‚Üí **Virtual Machine**
- Select the following:
  - **Image**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (or latest)
  - **Size**: Standard B1s (or any preferred size)
  - **Authentication**: Use SSH public key or password
  - **Inbound Ports**: Allow SSH (port 22)
- Click **Review + Create**, then **Create**

---

### üîó 2. Connect to the VM

Use **Git Bash**, **Windows Terminal**, or any terminal that supports SSH:

```bash
ssh azureuser@<public-ip-address>
