## üìå What is Docker?

**Docker** is an open-source platform that enables containerization ‚Äî packaging applications with their dependencies into isolated units called **containers**. It ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

* Docker is a containerization tool.
* Virtualization -> Fixed hardware allocation
* Process Isolation -> Dependency in OS is removed

## üÜö Containerization vs Virtualization

| Feature               | Virtualization                              | Containerization                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| OS Usage              | Full OS per VM                              | Shared OS, isolated environments               |
| Boot Time             | Minutes                                     | Seconds                                        |
| Resource Efficiency   | Heavy (needs full OS per VM)                | Lightweight (shares OS kernel)                |
| Performance Overhead  | High                                         | Low                                            |
| Use Case              | Legacy apps, full isolation                 | Microservices, DevOps, fast deployment         |

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Containerization

- **Lightweight** and fast
- **Portable** across different systems
- **Isolated** environments
- Ideal for **CI/CD pipelines**
- Simplifies **deployment** and **scaling**

### ü™ü On Windows (Using Docker Desktop)
1. Download Docker Desktop from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Install and restart your system
3. Open Docker Desktop and ensure it's running
4. Test the installation:
