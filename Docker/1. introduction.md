# 🐳 Docker Introduction

## 📌 What is Docker?

**Docker** is an open-source platform designed to help developers build, ship, and run applications in **containers**. A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software — including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

---

## 🚀 Why Use Docker?

- **Portability**: Works the same on any system.
- **Isolation**: Each container runs independently.
- **Speed**: Faster setup and deployment.
- **Lightweight**: Uses fewer resources compared to virtual machines.

## 🧱 Core Docker Components

| Component     | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Image**     | A read-only template used to create containers |
| **Container** | A runnable instance of an image |
| **Dockerfile**| A text file with instructions to build an image |
| **Docker Hub**| Cloud-based registry for Docker images |

## 🔧 Common Use Cases

- Microservices architecture
- CI/CD pipelines
- Local development environments
- Cloud-native deployment

```bash
docker build -t my-python-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-app
